### Why was this application created?
1. [Hackaton Google AI challenges](https://googleai.devpost.com/)  
Build a creative app that uses Googleâ€™s Generative AI tools. Push the boundaries of what Gen AI apps can do with Gemini! 
2. A wish since teenage  
Since I was a teenager, I have really admired art. I prefer drawing art to written art. Even though I'm not good at drawing now, I already have art fundamentals that I've been building for 2-3 years. I can imagine a story but only through pictures. Thanks to current technological developments that have produced AI that can produce images. I can already produce images based on imagination (prompt text that I input into the model, text2image).
3. Current technologies  
The presence of the latest technology such as multimodal models such as Gemini-AI provides unlimited possibilities. This makes it possible for any idea I might have had to be realized. The idea of using multimodal models to generate stories based on image input without needing to create a special model to generate stories from images.

### App Description
